			<div class="col-md-9 text-justify"><h6 class="border-bottom border-white pb-3">There was a time where I felt uncomfortable in my clothes and my skin. I knew that I was carrying a little bit of extra weight compared to my friends around my age, and looking back now, it wasn't even that much. But it was enough at the time to knock my confidence - it got me down and I tried to diet. I didn't know what I was doing. I had no direction and without a plan, I made a lot of mistakes. I started to learn about nutrition and making slightly better food choices. I learned about training plans and making sure that the time I was spending in the gym was effective. Over the time I gained experience and knowledge through my trainers and mentors. <br/>
			he gym soon became my passion and appreciation kept me motivated, to train harder, and diet more. In no time I was on track towards my goal and that's when I knew what had to be done. I joined this line having this in mind that I will be able to train the bewildered masses as I was in the position at some point of my life. I've been in this line for almost 3 years now and my only goal is to educate and guide who are like me when I was confused and disoriented. <br/>
			I’m extremely humbled to have the level of support from my mentors and clients, and respect as a fitness and body composition coach, to now be in a position to help guide you to get in to the shape of your life.<br/>
			Remember, Dedication Has No Limitation!<br/>
			Train hard!</h6></div>

				<div><h2 class="text-primary mb-4">Being a personal trainer requires hard work, dedication, and proper education to effectively train clients. If I had to judge myself, I'd consider myself well-rounded. Let's look into the approach that I follow:</h2></div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-7 justify-content-center">
				<div>
					<h5 class="text-primary mb-4">Expert Level Exercise Performance</h5>
					<p>Knowing how to lift iron and perform bodyweight and cardio exercises remains a must for all trainers. However, there’s a difference between training yourself and others.I know all the fine points about performing various exercises. I also know the when, where, and how associated with the choice of exercises. I choose exercises wisely for clients in order for them to reach their goals.I expertise in knowing what particular exercises to line up in a session with a specific client, as well as the ability to match a client’s personality with a personalized workout routine that keeps them happy while still being effective.</p>
					<h5 class="text-primary mb-4">A Complete Understanding of Exercise Science</h5>
					<p>“Do you even lift, bro?” is a typical snarky question directed to know-it-alls who don’t know anything about weight training. I don’t want my clients asking this question. I know a lot more than just how to perform exercises with proper form. I understand human anatomy, physiology, and more. Doing so makes it a lot easier to better assist clients. Also, clients are going to ask questions related to metabolism, proper muscle recovery, and nutrition. Knowing how the body works allows me to answer questions related to metabolism, proper muscle recovery, and nutrition accurately or to direct a client toward a good reference source.</p>
					<h5 class="text-primary mb-4">Solid Knowledge of Nutrition</h5>
					<p>Personal trainers are not nutritionists or dieticians. Still, I am prepared to hear a lot of questions about diet. I hear questions about fad diets and dietary supplements — two things competing for client dollars. I know enough about nutrition to advise clients on basic food choices. Suggesting proper amounts of carbohydrate intake for exercise energy or steering people away from bad food choices is my job.</p>
					<h5 class="text-primary mb-4">A Desire to Keep Learning</h5>
					<p>Trainers who think they know everything fall quickly behind in an ever-changing industry. Sure, a lot of the “old school” training methods work. The basics of proper diet and exercise never really change, but the fitness industry does experience its changes and trends. I am on top of all changes and innovations. I benefit from continuing my learning. Anything that adds to or builds up a knowledge base is a positive. If I had a rule to follow, it would be to always seek to add and improve on current skills.</p>
